using namespace std;      /*This line is to import the entirity of the std namespace into current namespace of the program, this 
                          namespace basically used when have same function name or variable name in the program and we need to 
                          distinguish between them*/
namespace firstfun{     /* Here we are using namespace to distinguish the functions having same name */
  void func(){
  cout<<"firstfun";
  }
}
namespace secondfun{
  void func(){
  cout<<"secondfun";
    }
  }
 int main(){
  firstfun::func();   /*Here we are specifing which namespace we need */
  secondfun::func();
  }
 
Just try to print this program so that you can understand how the function with same name gets evaluated at the same time using 
namespace.


HEADER FILES AVAILABLE IN C++ FOR I/O OPERATIONS
1) iostream - stands for standard input-output stream.
2) iomanip - describes input output manipulators.
3) fstream - this mainly describes file system.

Mostly we use "cin" and "cout" which are similar to "scanf" and "printf" in c language.
